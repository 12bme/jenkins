/**
 * Implementation of the JNLP-connect protocol.
 *
 * The slave sends the master the slave name it wants to register as and the
 * computed HMAC of the slave name. If accepted the master will reply with a
 * confirmation response.
 *
 * This was the first protocol supported by Jenkins. JNLP slaves will use this
 * as a last resort when connecting to old versions of Jenkins masters.
