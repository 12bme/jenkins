<div>
    Specify a different host name alias for this Nectar server, such as "http://untrusted.acme.org:8080/hudson".
    This secondary host name
    is used to serve user contents and files in the workspace that may have some security risk
    to be served from within the primary Nectar server domain name (as HTTP requests to such
    domain include sessions.)

    <p>
    When this secondary host name is specified, all the untrusted content download will be
    redirected to this URL, thus eliminating this security issue. Leave it empty to disengage
    this feature.
