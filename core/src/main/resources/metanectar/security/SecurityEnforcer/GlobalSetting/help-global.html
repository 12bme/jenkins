    Specify if/how connected masters security settings are enforced. This option allows the administrator
    of DEV@PE to centrally manage the security setting of masters, without allowing individual master
    administrators to change the setting.

    <p>
    This is convenient for example if you want all your masters to have some uniform setup, or if you'd
    free up master administrators from wasting their time figuring out the LDAP parameters, etc.

    <p>
    Because of the asynchronous nature of the system, there's up to 1 minute delay until the change
    of this setting is propagated to the connected masters.
