    Restrict the provisioning of a master to a set of master provisioning nodes that have labels associated with the
    nodes.
    <p>This configuration option only takes effect before a master is provisioned. If this option is modified
    when a master is already provisioned then the master needs to be terminated and then re-provisioned for any
    modifications to take effect.</p>
