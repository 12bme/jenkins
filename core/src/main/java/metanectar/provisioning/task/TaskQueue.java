     *
     * TaskHolder goes through four state.
     * First it gets created,
     * then it gets started (starting this state, execution!=null),
     * then it gets completed (starting this state, isDone()==true),
     * then it gets joined (starting this state, joined==true)
     *
     * During the transition from created to started, the asynchronous computation gets going.
     * The completion of that triggers transition from started to completed. This either happens
     * through polling, or via callback of {@link FutureWithCallback}.
     * The transition from completed to joined will fire off a chained task, if needed.
     * Once the task gets to the joined state, it can be removed from {@link TaskQueue#queue} any time.
     *
     * State transition is guarded by the synchronized(this) to ensure atomicity.
