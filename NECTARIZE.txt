The presence of this file indicates that this Jenkins is turned into Nectar.

When we take OSS Jenkins and start our sustaining branches (aka Nectarize), a few changes need
to be made to POM. The 'nectarize' branch keeps track of the changes we need. The idea
is whenever we need to nectarize, we do so by merging this branch into it.
